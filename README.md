Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Isa, I am a developer based in Oslo!
I look like a narwhal in real life too ;). 

                                                                   Currently:

                       ****** studying ONLINE and at the UNIVERSITY to catch up on the theoratical side of programming. ********

                                            ************ love creating cute front-end details ***********

             * you can find me on hackerrank (just learned how to float) and you can see me swimming here : https://meek-granita-c32a52.netlify.app/  *

Fun Fact
"I love whales but the only one I ever saw was a beluga, in a zoo!"
